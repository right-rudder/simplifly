    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold">Get Started on Your Pilot Career</h3>
    <h4 class="text-3xl text-slate-600 italic py-5">SimpliFly specializes in solely Career Track Pilot Training in Mesa, AZ</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">Start your pilot career after getting your commercial certificate. Start flying now and build the necessary hours to become an airline pilot. One way SimpliFly can help is by becoming a certified flight instructor (CFI).  Being a CFI offers a valuable opportunity to rapidly accumulate flight experience for the minimum requirements of airlines and corporate aviation companies. It is a great opportunity that allows you to apply all the knowledge and skills acquired during your own flight training. Flight instructors play a crucial role as ambassadors of the aviation community, imparting their knowledge and experience to their students. For many, it serves as their first aviation job that not only is an invaluable experience but also provides compensation.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">How Long Will it Take?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">Becoming a flight instructor does not have a minimum time, but you do need a commercial pilot license along with an instrument rating. To qualify for a commercial pilot license, a pilot must accumulate a minimum of 250 flight hours. That being said, if the minimum requirements are met it can take a little over a week to complete training if you are studying full time (accelerated).  If studying part time when able (flexible), it can take from a few weeks to a few months to be prepared for the CFI checkride and receive your endorsement.</p>

    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">What are the Eligibility Requirements?</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc text-lg pl-10 lg:pl-16">
      <li>Be 18 years of age</li>
      <li>Read, speak, write and understand the English language</li>
      <li>Hold a commercial pilot certificate and an instrument rating</li>
      <li>Have logged at least 250 hours of flight time</li>
      <li>Hold a valid FAA 3rd Class Medical Cerificate (or higher)</li>
      <li>Receive a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor on the fundamentals of instructing</li>
      <li>Pass a knowledge test on the aeronautical knowledge areas appropriate to the flight instructor rating sought</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-slate-600 italic pt-5">Reference 14 CFR §61.183 for the entire list of eligibility requirements.</p>
