    <p class="w-3/4">
      The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires all pilots to meet certain medical standards to ensure that they are physically and mentally fit to fly. At SimpliFly, we understand that the medical exam can seem daunting, which is why we provide support and guidance to our students throughout the process.
    </p>
    <p class="w-3/4 py-10">
      We work closely with certified aviation medical examiners and will be able to link you up with an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME).  Our experienced team of instructors will help you through the exam process, explain what the exam entails, and what conditions may disqualify you from obtaining a pilot's license. We'll provide you with tips on how to prepare for the exam, including what to bring, what to expect on the day, and how to deal with any potential issues that may arise.

      Obtaining your pilot's license involves passing a written exam, which serves as the crucial second step in the process. This comprehensive examination encompasses a wide range of subjects, including regulations, airspace, weather, aerodynamics, and aircraft performance. It serves as a means to assess your knowledge and ensure that you possess a deep understanding of the essential aspects required to be a safe and competent pilot.
