    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold">Get Your Private Pilot Certificate</h3>
    <h4 class="text-3xl text-slate-600 italic py-5">Simplifly Offers Accelerated and Flexible Training Options</h4>
    <p class="text-lg">The first step in becoming a pilot is to get your private pilot certificate.  With a private pilot certificate, you are given the privilege of flying an aircraft and being the pilot in command (PIC). Flight training includes aircraft maneuvers, navigation, emergency procedures and cross-country flight planning. While people may seek the license for hobby or sport reasons, a private pilot certification is the first major milestone on the road to becoming an airline pilot.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">How Long Will it Take?</h3>
    <p class="text-lg">The amount of time required to earn a private pilot certificate varies and largely depends on weather, availability, finances, and how often a student is available to fly. In our accelerated program, a pilot certificate can be earned in approximately two months. If flying only a few times a week, expect to be ready for your checkride in a few months to a year.</p>

    <h3 class="text-5xl font-header uppercase font-semibold pt-20 pb-5">What are the Eligibility Requirements?</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc text-lg pl-10 lg:pl-16">
      <li>Be 17 years of age</li>
