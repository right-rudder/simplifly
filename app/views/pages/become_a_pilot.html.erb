Or have a career in aviation in a different type of pilot job role?  </p>
    <p class="p-text w-3/4 lg:w-1/2  pt-10">Do you want to fly helicopters or airplanes?  How much time can you dedicate each week to flight training?

    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">The first decision you can make is whether you want to fly helicopters (rotary wing) or airplanes (fixed wing).  Schedule a time to meet with our team, tour our hangar, and take flight in one of our aircraft.  During a discovery flight, you'll be paired up with one of our highly qualified FAA certificated flight instructors.</p>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">You'll get the chance to sit in the pilot seat and commandeer the aircraft.  Your instructor will help you taxi the aircraft out of the ramp and receive clearance from the control tower.  Once airborne, you'll take control of the aircraft and practice basic maneuvers like flying straight and level, turns, climbs, and descents.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center font-semibold text-2xl py-20 lg:hidden">What's the difference between <br>Part 141 and Part 61?</h2>
      <p class="w-4/5 lg:w-3/5 grid place-items-center pb-10 p-text">Part 141 and Part 61 refer to different sections in the FAA regulations.  Part 141 is a more structured and rigorous training program that is designed for schools that are approved by the FAA to provide training under specific curricula.  Part 61, on the other hand, is a more flexible training program that allows for individualized training plans; however being less structured, students may require more hours to complete Part 61 training.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold pb-10 font-sans mx-5 text-center">Is Flight Training Safe?</h2>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10"> It's natural to wonder about the risks involved when considering learning to fly. Rest assured that flight training is a safe activity, with a strong emphasis on safety in all aspects of training.  The aviation industry places a high priority on safety, and this commitment extends to flight training at Ideal Aviation.</p>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">The NTSB reported that the fatal accident rate for general aviation has been declining for over a decade, and in 2020, it reached its lowest level ever recorded.  In 2019, the FAA reported that the accident rate for Part 141 flight schools was lower than the rate for Part 61 flight schools.</p>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10 font-semibold font-sans">Our flight instructors are highly trained professionals who take safety seriously.  In addition, our aircraft are meticulously maintained and inspected regularly.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold pb-10 font-sans mx-5 text-center">How Much is Flight Training Going to Cost?</h2>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">The cost of flight training varies greatly depending on a number of factors such as type of training, the student's aptitude and experience level, and the type of aircraft used.</p>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">When first starting out, many people only look at the hourly rate for aircraft rental.  However, take into consideration the program as a whole.  Ideal Aviation has great aircraft availability so you can fly more often and retain your knowledge and skills better so you can pass the checkride in a shorter time.</p>
    <p class="w-3/4 pb-10">Although the actual cost of flight training can vary widely, plan to budget around $15,000 for private pilot fixed wing and $30,000 for private pilot rotary wing.
